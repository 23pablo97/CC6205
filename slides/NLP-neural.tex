\begin{frame}{Supervised Learning}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The essence of supervised machine learning is the creation of mechanisms that can look at examples and produce generalizations. \cite{goldberg2017neural}
\item We design an algorithm whose input is a set of labeled examples, and
its output is a function (or a program) that receives an instance and produces the desired label.
\item Example: if the task is to distinguish from spam and not-spam email, the labeled examples are emails labeled as spam and emails labeled as not-spam.
\item It is expected that the resulting function will produce correct label
predictions also for instances it has not seen during training.
\item This approach differs from designing an algorithm to perform the task (e.g., manually designed rule-based systems).
\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Parameterized Functions}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Searching over the set of all possible functions is a very hard (and rather ill-defined) problem. \cite{goldberg2017neural}
\item We often restrict ourselves to search over specific families of functions.
\item Example: the space of all linear functions with $d_{in}$ inputs and $d_{out}$ outputs, 
\item Such families of functions are called \textbf{hypothesis classes}. 
\item By restricting ourselves to a specific hypothesis class, we are injecting the learner with \textbf{inductive bias}.
\item Inductive bias: a set of assumptions about the form of the desired solution.
\item Some hypothesis classes facilitate efficient procedures for searching for the solution. \cite{goldberg2017neural}
\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Linear Models}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item One common hypothesis class is that of high-dimensional linear function:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f(x) = \vec{x} \cdot W + \vec{b}\\
\vec{x} \in  \mathcal{R}^{d_{in}} & \quad W \in  \mathcal{R}^{d_{in}\times d_{out}} \quad \vec{b} \in  \mathcal{R}^{d_{out}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\item The vector $\vec{x}$ is the input to the function.
\item The matrix $W$ and the vector $\vec{b}$ are the parameters.

\item The goal of the learner is to set the values of the parameters $W$ and $\vec{b}$ such that the function behaves as intended on a collection of input values $\vec{x}_{1:k} = \vec{x}_1,\dots,\vec{x}_k$ and the corresponding desired outputs $\vec{y}_{1:k} = \vec{y}_1,\dots,\vec{y}_k$

\item The task of searching over the space of functions is thus reduced to one of searching over the space of parameters. \cite{goldberg2017neural}

\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}

\begin{frame}{Example: Language Detection}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider the task of distinguishing documents written in English from documents written in German.
\item This is a binary classifcation problem 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f(x) = \vec{x} \cdot w + b\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
 $d_{out}=1$, $w$ is a vector, and $b$ is a scalar. 

 \item The range of the linear function in is $[-\infty,\infty]$.
 \item In order to use it for binary classification, it is common to pass the output of $f(x)$ through the $sign$ function, mapping negative values to -1 (the negative class) and non-negative values to +1 (the positive class).
\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Example: Language Detection}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}

\item Letter frequencies make for quite good predictors (features) for this task.
\item Even more informative are counts of letter bigrams , i.e., pairs of consecutive letters.
\item We assume we have an alphabet of 28 letters (a–z, space, and a special symbol for all other characters including digits, punctuations, etc.)
\item Documents are represented as $28\times28$ dimensional vectors $\vec{x} \in \mathcal{R}^{784}$.
\item Each entry $\vec{x}_{[i]}$  represents a count of a particular letter combination in the document, normalized by the document's length.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction to Neural Networks}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Very popular machine learning models formed by units called \textbf{neurons}.
\item A neuron is a computational unit that has scalar inputs and outputs. 
\item  Each input has an associated weight $w$.
 \item The neuron multiplies each input by its weight, and then sums them (other functions such as \textbf{max} are also possible). 
\item It applies an activation function $g$ (usually non-linear) to the result, and passes it to its output.
\item Multiple layers can be stacked.
\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Activation Functions}

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The nonlinear activation function $g$ has a crucial role in the network's ability to represent complex functions. 
\item Without the nonlinearity in g, the neural network can only represent linear transformations of the input.
\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}

\begin{frame}{Brief Introduction to Neural Networks}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The feedforward network from the picture is a stack of linear models separated by nonlinear functions.
\item The values of each row of neurons in the network can be thought of as a vector. 

\item The input layer is a 4-dimensional vector $(\vec{x})$, and the layer above it is a 6-dimensional vector $(\vec{h}^1)$.
\item The fully connected layer can be thought of as a linear transformation from 4 dimensions to 6 dimensions. 
\item A fully connected layer implements a vector-matrix multiplication, $\vec{h}=\vec{x}W$.
\item The weight of the connection from the $i$-th neuron in the input row to the $j$-th neuron in the output row is $W_{[i,j]}$.
\item The values of $\vec{h}$ are transformed by a nonlinear function $g$ that is applied to each value before being passed on as input to the next layer.

\end{itemize}

\footnotetext{Vectors are assumed to be row vectors and superscript indices correspond to network layers.}

\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Brief Introduction to Neural Networks}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from the figure can be written as the following mathematical function:
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
NN_{MLP2}(\vec{x}) & =  \vec{y}  \\
\vec{h}^{1} &  = g^{1}(\vec{x}W^{1}+\vec{b}^{1}) \\
\vec{h}^{2} &  = g^{2}(\vec{h}^{1}W^{2}+\vec{b}^{2}) \\
\vec{y} &  = \vec{h}^{2}W^{3}\\
\vec{y} &  = (g^2(g^1(\vec{x}W^{1}+\vec{b}^{1})W^2+\vec{b}^2))W^3.\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{center}
%NN_{MLP2(x)}  =  y \\
%h^{1} = g^{1}(xW^{1}+b{1}) \\

\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Network Training}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  When training a neural network one defines a loss function $L(\hat{y}, y)$, stating the loss of predicting $\hat{y}$ when the true output is y.

\item The training objective is then to minimize the loss across the different training examples. 

\item Networks are trained using  gradient-based methods.

\item They work by repeatedly computing an estimate of the loss $L$ over the training set.

\item They compute gradients of the parameters with respect to the loss estimate, and moving the parameters in the opposite directions of the gradient. 

\item Different optimization methods differ in how the error estimate is computed, and how moving in the opposite direction of the gradient is defined.

\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Online Stochastic Gradient Descent}


\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	 \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{pics/Online-SGD.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The learning rate can either be fixed throughout the
training process, or decay as a function of the time step $t$.
\item  The error calculated in line 3 is based on a single training example, and is thus just a rough estimate of the corpus-wide loss $L$ that we are aiming to minimize. 
\item The noise in the loss computation may result in inaccurate gradients (single examples may provide noisy information).

\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}

\footnotetext{Source:\cite{goldberg2016primer}}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent}


\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item A common way of reducing this noise is
to estimate the error and the gradients based on a sample of $m$ examples.
\item This gives rise to the minibatch SGD algorithm




\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	 \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{pics/minibatch-SGD.png}
\end{figure}

\item Higher values of $m$ provide better estimates of the corpus-wide gradients, while smaller values allow more updates and in turn faster convergence.

\item For modest sizes of $m$ , some computing architectures (i.e., GPUs) allow an efficient parallel implementation of the computation in lines 3-6.

\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Some Loss Functions}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Hinge (or SVM loss):  for binary classification problems, the classifier's output is a single scalar $\tilde{y}$ and the intended output y is in $\{+1,-1\}$.  The classification rule is $\hat{y} = sign(\tilde{y})$, and a classification is considered correct if $y \cdot \tilde{y} > 0$.  
 \begin{displaymath}
  L_{\text{hinge}(\text{binary})}(\tilde{y},y) = \max(0,1-y \cdot \tilde{y})  
 \end{displaymath}

 \item Binary cross entropy (or logistic loss): is used in binary classification with conditional probability outputs. The classifier's output $\tilde{y}$ is transformed using the sigmoid function to the range $[0,1]$ , and is interpreted as the conditional probability $P(y=1|x)$.
  \begin{displaymath}
  L_{\text{logistic}}(\hat{y},y) = -y \log \hat{y} - (1-y) \log(1-\hat{y})  
 \end{displaymath}
 
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Some Loss Functions}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}

 \item Categorical cross-entropy loss:  is used when a probabilistic interpretation of multi-class scores is desired. It measures the dissimilarity between the true label distribution $y$ and the predicted label distribution $\tilde{y}$. 
   \begin{displaymath}
  L_{\text{cross-entropy}}(\hat{y},y) = - \sum_{i} y_{[i]} \log(\hat{y}_{[i]})   
 \end{displaymath}
\item The predicted label distribution of the categorical cross-entropy loss ($\hat{y}$) is obtained by applying the softmax function the last layer of the network $\tilde{y}$:
    \begin{displaymath}
\hat{y}_{[i]} = \text{softmax}(\tilde{y})_{[i]} =  \frac{e^{\tilde{y}_{[i]}}}{\sum_{j}e^{\tilde{y}_{[j]}}}   
 \end{displaymath}
 
\item The softmax function squashes the $k$-dimensional output to values in the range (0,1) with all entries adding up to 1. Hence, $\hat{y}_{[i]} = P( y = i |x)$ represent the class membership conditional distribution.
 
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}


\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{The Computation Graph Abstraction}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  One can compute the gradients of the various parameters of a network by hand and implement them in code.

\item This procedure is cumbersome and error prone.

\item For most purposes, it is preferable to use automatic tools for gradient computation [Bengio, 2012].

\item A computation graph is a representation of an arbitrary mathematical computation (e.g., a neural network) as a graph.

\item Consider for example a graph for the computation of $(a*b+1)*(a*b+2)$:

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	 \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{pics/compGraph.png}
\end{figure}

\item The computation of $a*b$ is shared.

\item The graph structure defines the order of the computation in terms of the dependencies between the different components.

\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}{The Computation Graph Abstraction}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}

\item  Te computation graph abstraction allows us to:


\begin{enumerate}
\begin{scriptsize}
 \item Easily construct arbitrary networks.
 \item Evaluate their predictions for given inputs (forward pass)
 
 \begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	 \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{pics/forwardPass.png}
\end{figure}

 
 
 \item Compute gradients for their parameters with respect to arbitrary scalar losses (backward pass or backpropagation).
 
 
  
 \begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	 \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{pics/backwardPass.png}
\end{figure}
 
\end{scriptsize}
 \end{enumerate}
  
  
  
  
 \item The backpropagation algorithm (backward pass) is essentially following the chain-rule of differentiation\footnote{A comprehensive tutorial on the backpropagation algorithm over the computational graph abstraction: \url{https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/}}.
 
  
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Train, Test, and Validation Sets}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Neural networks are prone to overfit the data.
\item Hence, performance on training data can be misleading.
\item Held-out set: split training set into training and testing subsets (80\% and 20\% splits). Train on training and compute accuracy on testing.
\item Problem: in practice you often train several models, compare their quality, and select the best one. 
\item Selecting the best model according to the held-out set's accuracy will result in an overly optimistic estimate of the model's quality.
\item You don't know if the chosen settings of the final classifier are good in general, or are just good for the particular examples in the held-out sets.

\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Train, Test, and Validation Sets}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item The accepted methodology is to use a three-way split of the data into train, validation (also called development ), and test sets \footnote{An alternative approach is cross-validation, but it doesn't scale well for training deep neural networks.}. 
\item This gives you two held-out sets: a validation set (also called development set ), and a test set.
\item All the experiments, tweaks, error analysis, and model selection should be performed based on the validation set. 
\item Then, a single run of the final model over the test set will give a good estimate of its expected quality on unseen examples. 
\item It is important to keep the test set as pristine as possible, running as few experiments as possible on it. 
\item Some even advocate that you should not even look at the examples in the test
set, so as to not bias the way you design your model.



\end{itemize}
